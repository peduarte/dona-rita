			<h2>London’s first Brazilian Cheese Balls pop up returns to Old St this November. Only this time the balls are looking rather different.</h2>


			<p>In case you missed their first pop-up, Brazilian Cheese Balls are the go-to snack in Latin America and they’re quickly becoming a hit in London. Made with Cassava and Cheese, they are crunchy outside and cloud-like inside - plus naturally gluten free. </p>

			<p>After serving over 10,000 balls last May, Dona Rita is baking a comeback. Look out for more than the traditional version this time... Each week Rita will make a small batch of Cheese Balls with a twist - and serve them until they sell out. What are the weekly specials? Blood-Injected Charcoal Balls for Halloween. Emoji-inspired Matcha and Beetroot Lollypop, in celebration of Autumn colourful ingredients. Manchego and Kimchi balls are also on the list, following a weekend collaboration with Kimchi expert Lily Hirasawa. In short: this November, gluten free breakfast just became a lot less boring.</p>

			<p>Dona Rita’s mission is to bring Brazil’s favourite snack to London. When Rita left the tropics for Norwich she missed Pão de Queijo so much she started baking it from scratch, rolling every puff by hand and using the freshest traditional ingredients. She has been perfecting her secret family recipe for the last 15 years, and now, with the help of her son Pedro, is sharing it with Londoners.</p>

			<p>Rita found an immediate fan in Pedro’s girlfriend Clara, who is allergic to gluten. Clara became obsessed with the little cheese bread puffs when she tried them for the first time - they were too good to be gluten free, and too good not to share with everyone outside of Brazil. She encouraged Rita and Pedro to turn their family tradition into a London food venture, and Dona Rita opened for business in 2017.</p>

			<p>3 balls for £2.50, 6 balls for £4.50 and toppings for 50p. For the addicts, Dona Rita will have bake-at-home packs for sale - 15 frozen balls in each pack for a fiver. </p>

			<p class="small faded measure-wider">You can find the stall in front of the ticket hall at Old Street Underground Station, from the 31st of October to the 26th of November, 7.30am to 7pm. Open until late on Halloween. More info at www.donarita.co.uk</p>
