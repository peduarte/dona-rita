			<h2>On Halloween, descend to the entrails of London to feast on a bloody snack. The spooktacular pop up serving Brazilian Cheese Balls is back, launching on October 31st in the darkest corner of Old Street Station.</h2>


			<p>In case you missed their first pop-up - Brazilian Cheese Balls are the go-to snack in Latin America and they’re quickly becoming a hit in London. Made with Cassava and Cheese, they are crunchy outside  and cloud-like inside - plus naturally gluten free.</p>

			<p>Only this time they don’t look as innocent as they used to…</p>

			<p>Chef Rita has made a special batch for Halloween with Activated Charcoal. It’s a dark and detoxifying twist to her original recipe. Don’t be creeped out by their burned, cracked look: they taste like a melted-cheese inferno. They’re served with a Syringe, filled with your choice of sweet or spicy blood (don’t worry, it’s only jam and Sriracha sauce). How do you eat them? It’s also your choice: inject the balls with blood, spill it all over for a gore look or pour it in your mouth as Halloween make up - be creative.</p>

			<p>A portion of 6 blood-injected charcoal balls is £5. For the addicts, Dona Rita will have the original bake-at-home packs for sale - 15 frozen balls in each pack for a fiver.</p>

			<p class="small faded measure-wider">You can find the stall in front of the ticket hall at Old Street Underground Station, from the 31st of October to the 26th of November, 7.30am to 7pm. Open until late on Halloween. More info at www.donarita.co.uk</p>
