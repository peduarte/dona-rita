	"text": "A proper Pao de Queijo is a two-bite business: crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Made with cassava flour and fresh cheese, it was farmers’ try at making european bread without wheat. It’s cheesily addictive and naturally gluten free. For Brazilians, there’s never a bad time to eat one - at their local cafe, at a restaurant or from the grocery store."
