	"text": "Pao de Queijo is the croissant of Brazil. People eat it in cafes and bars, bake it from scratch at home or buy ready-made ones at the supermarket. A proper Pao de Queijo is a two-bite business: crunchy on the outside and tenderly cheesy on the inside. Cassava flour and fresh mozzarella are the core ingredients of this happy marriage between native america and italian immigration. Brazilians eat it at any time and pretty much under any excuse."
