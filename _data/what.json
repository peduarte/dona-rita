	"title": "AKA Pão de Queijo",
	"text": "A proper Pao de Queijo is a two-bite business: crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Made with cassava flour and fresh cheese, it’s a farmer's take on traditional European bread - without the wheat. Pao de queijo is a staple snack at most cafes, restaurants and dinner parties across Brazil. It’s cheesily addictive and naturally gluten free. Try pairing it with a short black coffee Sao Paulo style, or spread thickly with guava jam for a sweet contrast. "
