Rita has been perfecting her secret recipe for the last 15 years. Meanwhile her son Pedro and his girlfriend Clara eat every new batch that comes out of the oven, daydreaming about making a little family business out of it. They hope youâ€™re as excited as they are when you try it for the first time."
